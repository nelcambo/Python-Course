# Solving simple mathematical problems
# Now you should be able to construct a short program solving simple mathematical problems such as the Pythagorean theorem:

# The square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

# The following code evaluates the length of the hypotenuse (i.e., the longest side of a right-angled triangle, the one opposite of the right angle) using the Pythagorean theorem:

a = 3.0
b = 4.0
c = (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5
print("c =", c)


# Note: we need to make use of the ** operator to evaluate the square root as:

# √ (x)  = x(½)

# and

# c = √ a2 + b2 

# Can you guess the output of the code?

# Check below and run the code in the editor to confirm your predictions.

# Check
# c = 5.0
