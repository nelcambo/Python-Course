Congratulations! You have completed Module 2.

Well done! You've reached the end of Module 2 and completed a major milestone in your Python programming education. Here's a short summary of the objectives you've covered and got familiar with in Module 2:

the basic methods of formatting and outputting data offered by Python, together with the primary kinds of data and numerical operators, their mutual relations and bindings;
the concept of variables and variable naming conventions;
the assignment operator, the rules governing the building of expressions;
the inputting and converting of data;

You are now ready to take the module quiz and attempt the final challenge: Module 2 Test, which will help you gauge what you've learned so far.
