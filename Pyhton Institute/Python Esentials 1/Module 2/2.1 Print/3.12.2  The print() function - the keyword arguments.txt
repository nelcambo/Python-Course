The print() function - the keyword arguments
And now it's time to try something more difficult.

print("My name is ", end="")
print("Monty Python.")


If you look carefully, you'll see that we've used the end argument, but the string assigned to it is empty (it contains no characters at all).

What will happen now? Run the program in the editor to find out.

As the end argument has been set to nothing, the print() function outputs nothing too, once its positional arguments have been exhausted.

The console should now be showing the following text:

My name is Monty Python.
output

Note: no newlines have been sent to the output.

The string assigned to the end keyword argument can be of any length. Experiment with it if you want.
