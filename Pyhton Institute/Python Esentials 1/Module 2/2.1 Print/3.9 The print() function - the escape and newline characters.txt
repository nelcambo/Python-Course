The print() function - the escape and newline characters
This convention has two important consequences:

1. If you want to put just one backslash inside a string, don't forget its escaping nature - you have to double it, e.g., such an invocation will cause an error:

print("\")


while this one won't:

print("\\")


2. Not all escape pairs (the backslash coupled with another character) mean something.


Experiment with your code in the editor, run it, and see what happens.
