The print() function
The only argument delivered to the print() function in this example is a string:

print("Hello, World!")


As you can see, the string is delimited with quotes - in fact, the quotes make the string - they cut out a part of the code and assign a different meaning to it.

You can imagine that the quotes say something like: the text between us is not code. It isn't intended to be executed, and you should take it as is.

Almost anything you put inside the quotes will be taken literally, not as code, but as data. Try to play with this particular string - modify it, enter some new content, delete some of the existing content.


There's more than one way to specify a string inside Python's code, but for now, though, this one is enough.


The concept of the 'Hello, World!' string


So far, you have learned about two important parts of the code: the function and the string. We've talked about them in terms of syntax, but now it's time to discuss them in terms of semantics.
