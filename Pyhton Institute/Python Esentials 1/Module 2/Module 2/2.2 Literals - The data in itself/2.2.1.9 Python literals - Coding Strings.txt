Coding strings
Now, the next question is: how do you embed an apostrophe into a string placed between apostrophes?

You should already know the answer, or to be precise, two possible answers.

Try to print out a string containing the following message:

I'm Monty Python.

Do you know how to do it? Click Check below to see if you were right:

Check


print("I'm Monty Python.")

or 

print("I\'m Monty Python.")

or 

print('I\'m Monty Python.')



As you can see, the backslash is a very powerful tool - it can escape not only quotes, but also apostrophes.

We've shown it already, but we want to emphasize this phenomenon once more - a string can be empty - it may contain no characters at all.

An empty string still remains a string:

''
""

print(type('')) returns <class 'str'> 
print(type("")) also returns <class 'str'>
