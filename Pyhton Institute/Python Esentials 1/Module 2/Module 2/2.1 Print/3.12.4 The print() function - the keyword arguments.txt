The print() function - the keyword arguments
Both keyword arguments may be mixed in one invocation, just like here in the editor window.

The example doesn't make much sense, but it visibly presents the interactions between end and sep.

print("My", "name", "is", sep="_", end="*")
print("Monty", "Python.", sep="*", end="*\n")


Can you predict the output?

Run the code and see if it matches your predictions.

Now that you understand the print() function, you're ready to consider how to store and process data in Python.

Without print(), you wouldn't be able to see any results.
