Welcome to Python Essentials 1 

This course is the first in a 2-course series that will prepare you for the PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer and PCAP: Certified Associate in Python Programming certification exams.

The main goal of the course is to guide you from a state of complete programming illiteracy to a level of programming knowledge which allows you to design, write, debug, and run programs encoded in the Python language, and to understand the basic concepts of software development technology.

The course will prepare you for jobs and careers connected with widely understood software development, which includes not only creating the code itself as a junior developer, but also computer systems design and software testing.
