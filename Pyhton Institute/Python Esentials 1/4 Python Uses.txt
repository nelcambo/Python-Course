Where do you use Python?
Do you remember Battlefield 2, Battlefield 2142 and Battlefield Heroes - strategy and first person shooter games from EA DICE? All the games use Python for logic and server controls. Python is frequently used for creating open-source, free games, e.g., OpenRTS, PySol, Metin 2, or Frets On Fire - famous Guitar Hero-like games written in pygame.

And what about the major websites and services? Dropbox? UBER? Spotify? Pintrest? BuzzFeed? Yes. They were all written, to a greater or lesser extent, in Python. Other examples?

Enterprise Applications (Odoo, Tryton, Picalo, LinOTP 2, RESTx)
Image Applications (Gnofract 4D, Gogh, imgSeek, MayaVi, VPython)
Mobile Applications (Aarlogic C05/3, AppBackup, Pyroute)
Office Applications (calibre, faces, Notalon, pyspread)

Generally, Python is a great choice for:

Web and Internet development (e.g., Django and Pyramid frameworks, Flask and Bottle micro-frameworks)
Scientific and numeric computing (e.g., SciPy - a collection of packages for the purposes of mathematics, science, and engineering; Ipython - an interactive shell that features editing and recording of work sessions)
Education (it's a brilliant language for teaching programming! And that's why we're offering this course to you!)
Desktop GUIs (e.g., wxWidgets, Kivy, Qt)
Software Development (build control, management, and testing - Scons, Buildbot, Apache Gump, Roundup, Trac)
Business applications (ERP and e-commerce systems - Odoo, Tryton)

And many, many other projects and development tools.
